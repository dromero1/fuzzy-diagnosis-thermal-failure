*Expert system for evaluating the thermal condition of power transformers*

This work extends a Fuzzy Inference System proposed by Herre√±o (2015) for assessing power transformers' thermal condition. Such an expert system estimates the criticality level of a thermic breakdown from the concentration in ppm of ethylene and ethane in the device's oil. Case in point, the adaptation deals with some issues regarding a surplus of information entropy, high-dimensional parameter spaces, and the inadequate intersection of adjacent membership by scaling the variables, simplifying the membership functions, and tailoring the standard deviation parameters. Results show that a reasonable representation can be achieved by slightly compromising the fitting error to the validation dataset. In addition, experiments show that the selection of the defuzzification method has a significant influence on the shape, smoothness, and convergence of the response surface. Contrastingly, preliminary evidence may insinuate that the choice of T-norm and S-norm does not have the same effect.
